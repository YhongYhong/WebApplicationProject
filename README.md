# WebApplicationProject

WebApplicationProject is a website about gathering people to do some activity like playing football or playing badminton together.
This project is part of the 'Web Application Development Project' course in our second year. Our group has a total of five members, and we are focusing on the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. I am responsible for backend development.
